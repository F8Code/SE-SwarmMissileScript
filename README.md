This a custom-made missile script for the game Space Engineers. <br />
It works coupled with a missile of my own design, which in short is a cluster missile that doesn't release bombs, but rather smaller child-like missiles mid-air. <br />
You can kind of look at it as the jerycho missile from the movie 'Iron Man'. I've tried really hard to have the missile fit in the smallest size format possible, while maximizin the ammount of sub-missiles it carries. <br />
Despite lot's of work, I've decided to abandon the project, as after initial tests I've found out that the idea of using missile clusters is simply way less effective then using bomb clusters and requires a way bigger programming workload. <br />
You can check out a short post on this missile that I've made on reddit: <br />
